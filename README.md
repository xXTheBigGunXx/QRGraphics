# QRGraphics

Welcome to my first GitHub repository! ðŸŽ‰  

## About  
This is my personal project where I aim to re-create a QR code generator. Through this journey, I am learning how to:  
- Work with graphical interfaces.  
- Gather information from the internet about QR codes and their creation.  
- Get familiar with Git and GitHub by committing and managing my code.  

## Goals  
- Build a functional QR code generator.  
- Improve my understanding of GUI development.  
- Gain experience with Git and GitHub workflows.

## QR code creation explained

- Firstly I just create a screen that is all white. The only thing that is important for this step what the dimentions 
of a QR code output are correct to the desired one. Screen needs to be square and the input and the output dimensions differ
a little bit.
